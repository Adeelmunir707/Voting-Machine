A voting machine is a device used to record and tabulate votes in an election. Voting machines have been used since the late 19th century, and have been increasingly adopted in recent years as technology has advanced. The most common type of voting machine is the electronic voting machine, which records votes electronically, typically by a voter pressing buttons or touching a screen.
